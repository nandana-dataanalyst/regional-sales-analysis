# Regional Sales Performance Analysis
This project analyzes 4 years of sales data across four regions (West, East, Central, South) to identify revenue concentration, product performance, and regional weaknesses.

## Key Insights
- West and East generate over 60% of total revenue
- South is the weakest region due to lack of strong product categories
- Product strength drives customer performance more than sales effort

## Tools Used
- Excel (Pivot tables, charts, analysis)
- Power BI (dashboard)

This project was created as part of my Data Analyst portfolio.
